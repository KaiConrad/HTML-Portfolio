<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Kailey - a current CS student who's been trying to 
  expand my knowledge outside of the classroom. Hence why I've started a
Web Dev course on Udemy. </p>

<p>Though my previous degree was in English and Communications, 
  I've found that my interest in computers and building websites and games has
  been greater than my interest in writing. In addition to this, I was lucky enough
  to have a job in 2021 that allowed me to explore game development. From there, 
  I quickly realized that perhaps computer science, or atleast coding, was something I should look into. 
</p>

<p>Flash forward a couple of years, and now I'm back in college, while also trying to do all I can to learn more on the side.
  It's been difficult, but also fun - which I think makes everything a lot better. I've created short python games as part
  of coursework, and now I'm learning web development outside of the classroom - which is exciting. This portfolio is actually
  a result of the Udemy course I'm currently taking, and though it's just written in HTML, and will need CSS to look more appealing, 
  I feel as though this will be an interesting thing to come back to when I've learned more. If only to look back and see how far I've come.
